## About

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the interdisciplinary program of Second Language Acquisition and Teaching at the University of Arizona, with a focus on Learning Technologies and Digital Literacies. Coming from an interdisciplinary learning background myself (language, culture, literacy, education, human-computer interaction, speech technology, and educational technology), I research on how innovative combination of technology and humanity can spark creativity that might inform or even transform the future landscape of education. More specifically, I have researched on technology-enhanced language learning and teaching, autonomous/self-regulated learning, life-long learning, gameful learning, and transnational language usersâ€™ identities. I am also interested in interdisciplinary learning that blends science and humanities for future-ready learners. As an educator who has taught Chinese, English, and Spanish in both K-12 and university settings, I am committed to promoting multilingual/multicultural inclusion in education.

I use both qualitative and quantitative methods in my research and my approaches are influenced by complexity theory and ecological perspectives.
