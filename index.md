## About

I received my Ph.D. from the interdisciplinary program of [Second Language Acquisition and Teaching](https://slat.arizona.edu/) at the University of Arizona, with a focus on Learning Technologies and Digital Literacies. Coming from an interdisciplinary learning background myself (language, culture, literacy, education, human-computer interaction, speech technology, and educational technology), I am interested in how an innovative combination of technology and humanity can spark creativity that might inform or even transform the future landscape of education. More specifically, I have researched on technology-enhanced language learning and teaching, autonomous/self-regulated learning, life-long learning, gameful learning, multimodal literacies, and learnersâ€™ identities, motivation and agency. I am also interested in interdisciplinary learning that blends science and humanities for future-ready learners. As an educator who has taught Chinese, English, and Spanish in both K-12 and university settings, I am committed to promoting multilingual/multicultural inclusion in education.

I joined [Centre for Teaching Excellence at Singapore Management University](https://cte.smu.edu.sg/about-us/team) as a learning designer and educational developer in 2021. I work with faculty on course design, active learning, and innovative teaching practices for the university-wide blended learning initiative through consultations, workshops, and collaborations. I also work with faculty on educational research through consultations and collaborations at Singapore Management University.
